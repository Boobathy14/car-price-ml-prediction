## Abstract
The car price prediction has been more popular in the present times, and it needs predominant effort and information about the experts of this particular field. The number of differentattributes is measured and also it has been considerable to predict the result in more reliable and
accurate.Car Price Prediction is a project which is developed based on a machine learning
model. Datas for the deployment of the project has been collected from Kaggle. The main idea
behind this project is to calculate the price of the old car using machine learning prediction.
Here I pick a Random Forest algorithm for the most accurate learning rate. It produces a highly
accurate classifier when compared to other ML algorithms.

## INTRODUCTION
Predicting the price for cars is more interesting and needed by many users. The data set has
been collected from kaggle in the year of 2019 and says that 84 percent of cars had been bought
for their own personal usage. Later this percentage has increased very much because people are
more interested in buying new vehicles often and also showing more interest in finding the price
of new vehicles. This increases the efficiency of prediction techniques. Only with the help of
experts and their corresponding knowledge we can achieve more accurate predictions for
vehicle prices.

## Dataset:
For this project, Using the car dataset which is available on Kaggle. This dataset contains
information about used cars. link:Vehicle dataset | Kaggle
The attributes in the given dataset are as follows:
1. Name
2. Year
3. Selling_price
4. Km_driven
5. Fuel
6. Seller_type
7. Transmission
8. Owner

## 1. Linear Regression
Linear Regression was chosen as the first model due to its simplicity and comparatively small
training time. The features, without any feature mapping, were used directly as the feature
vectors. No regularization was used since the results clearly showed low variance.
## 2. Random Forest Random
Forest is an ensemble learning based regression model. It uses a model called decision tree,
specifically as the name suggests, multiple decision trees to generate the ensemble model which
collectively produces a prediction. The benefit of this model is that the trees are produced in
parallel and are relatively uncorrelated, thus producing good results as each tree is not prone to
individual errors of other trees.

## Data Visualization:
Data visualization is a very important part of the Data life-cycle. Below are few visualization
tools:
● Tableau
● Kibana
● Google Charts
● Datawrapper

## Data Wrangling:
Data wrangling is the process of cleaning and unifying messy and complex data sets for easy
access and analysis.
