# Car-price-ml-prediction
Car Price Prediction is a project which is developed based on a machine learning model. Datas for the deployment of project has been collected from Kaggle. The main idea behind this project is to calculate the price of the old car using machine learning prediction.
Here I pick Random Forest algorithm for the most accurate learning rate. It produces a highly accurate classifier when compare to other ML algorithm.
